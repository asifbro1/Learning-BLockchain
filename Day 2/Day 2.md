|  **Blockchain** |

BLockchain is a storage solution. It is basically a **distributed ledger**/database. That means that the database has the same(for now as far as i know) copies of it across different **peers**(each peer is a participant in the network, As far a iknow each peer has a complete copy of the network or at least enough of the transaction data to do validations). It acheives a consistent state  across all peers by means of consensus. **Consesnus** is the process of finding the next **block** that will be added to the blockchain.
